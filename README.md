# Basketball-game-schoolproject

This is a school team project in C/C++ as a part of our programming course in Mathematical Grammar School :)
Our task was to work in a team on creating a project in the programming language C/C++ where necessary was to use classes and objects. We implemented a console application that analyzes a basketball game and players (the application is user friendly with instructions to the user).
